# About Me

## My Interests

In my free time, I mostly play video games and talk with my husband, James, watch Youtube (primarily political and educational content), and play the card game _Magic: the Gathering_ with friends.

I also love to read philosophy and fiction; visiting local libraries has become a small passion of mine.

As far as favorite pieces of media go, I'd have to say:
 * _The VVitch_ is easily my favorite horror movie of all time.
 * "_The Name of the Wind_" by Patrick Rothfuss is tied with "Lord of the Rings" for the best fiction series I've ever read.
 * If you need any good Youtubers to watch, I highly recommend [PhilosophyTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PA-AKmVpU6NKCGtZq_rKQ), [Folding Ideas](www.youtube.com/foldingideas), and [Numberphile](www.youtube.com/numberphile).
 

## Websites I Recommend

 - [BlueSky](https://www.bsky.social) - A great alternative to Twitter after ...**_everything_** that's gone down there.
 
 - [MeetUP](https://www.meetup.com) - If you're looking into finding a group to share a hobby with or just chill, this is a great site to find likeminded people!
