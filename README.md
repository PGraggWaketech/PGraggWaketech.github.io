# About Me

## My Interests

In my free time, I mostly play video games and talk with my husband, James, watch Youtube (primarily political and educational content), and play the card game _Magic: the Gathering_ with friends.

I also love to read philosophy and fiction; visiting local libraries has become a small passion of mine.

## Websites I Recommend

 - [BlueSky](https://www.bsky.social) - A great alternative to Twitter after ...**_everything_** that's gone down there.
 
 - [MeetUP](https://www.meetup.com) - If you're looking into finding a group to share a hobby with or just chill, this is a great site to find likeminded people!
